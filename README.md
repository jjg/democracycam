DemocracyCam
============

An oppression-proof image aquisition device


"Democracy Cam" was described to me by Preston Austin as a camera that immediately shares the photos taken with other cameras and devices.  The basic idea is to prevent the capturing of one camera from stopping the flow of documentation during a protest, gathering, etc.

This version (Alpha Zero) is built from off-the-shelf parts and uses [Forban](https://github.com/adulau/Forban) to distribute photos to other devices that are on an [Openwireless.org] WiFi network.
